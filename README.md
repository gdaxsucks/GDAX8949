# GDAX8949
A shitty IRS 8949 generator for mother fucking GDAX data

## What the fuck is this shit?
This is a stupid piece of shit Java project I wrote in one fucking night because I need to turn in my fucking taxes
and those bullshit asshole motherfuckers at GDAX can't be bothered to spend a few dollars of their ill gotten gains 
to generate proper tax documents for you.

Here I am on a fucking Friday night hacking away at bullshit code. Yes, I tried fucking BitCoin.tax and their shit blew up 
on my fucking GDAX data. Same with TokenTax.us. Yes, I looked at a couple of these fucking GitHub projects that claim to do
what I wanted, and I spent enough fucking time trying to set up a functional Python or Node.js environment or whatever the fuck
stupid bullshit it was written in. I'm a fucking Java programmer so this is what you fucking get.

## Why the fuck do I need this shit?

You need this shit because those motherfuckers at Coinbase sent out a fucking 1099-K showing your gross transactions to the IRS.
If you were stupid enough to run a trading bot like I was, the dickwads at the IRS now knows that you received maybe millions of fucking dollars
even though it was just your same $1,000 traded back and forth thousands of fucking times. You lost or gained maybe $50 on the whole 
deal but now you have to account for every single fucking last transaction. Because they know. They fucking know, and they're going
to want fucking answers.

I'm not a fucking accountant. I had no fucking clue what a "cost basis" is but here I am figuring it out and probably getting it wrong.
"This is not tax advice" blah blah of course it fucking isn't. Use this shit at your own risk. Or don't. I don't fucking care.

## Using this stupid shit
You need to fucking download your reports for ETH, LTC, BTC, or whatever the fuck else you traded. Then you need to download your USD report.
What's that you say, you traded ETC for LTC or BTC? Well fuck, I don't even know if this shit is going to help you. I don't even want
to fucking think about your predicament. This is for regular fucking trades for regular fucking fiat currency. Yeah I said fiat, you like that,
you stupid little crypto fuck?

## Wait it isn't even done
I'm not done fucking uploading it you fucking nitwit. Don't worry it will all be up this weekend. My wife is on my fucking ass about it.

## Shit it doesn't fucking do
The list of shit it doesn't do is LONG. I don't even know what the fuck it doesn't do, that's what the fuck I know. Mostly it doesn't create
a PDF all pretty like the one those asshole douchebags from the fucking IRS give you. I don't think it fucking matters. Just give it to your 
fucking accountant.
